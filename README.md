### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Harit007x/Harit007x** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Health Care Project as a Full Stack Developer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DSA, System Design, Open Source
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding beginner-friendly projects for Open Source contributions
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about UI/UX, Full Stack Development, Positive Thinking
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/harit-patel-a7a1a5208/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wanted to become a UI/UX Designer but figured out I am good at coding too and became Full Stack Developer.
